If in a net, grasp the bill at all times to prevent serious injury to your face, eyes or fingers. Plastic crates are easy to clean and disinfect, and may be more resistant than wooden craters to bill ""shaving"" activities. Large slits or other openings should be covered with mesh so that the hornbills cannot manipulate the crate or bite. Risk of damage to the casque may be avoided by taping the casque and padding it with cardboard. Taping of the long tail with gummed paper might also prevent feather abrasion and breakage. A short length of knotted rope attached to the aviary roof above a favorite perch can be used by the hornbills to clean the inside of their bills. A hornbill should have sufficient time to become used to the crate before transport. If transport is longer than a couple of hours, water and food should be provided in the crate.
