<p>Always follow agency protocol when dealing with trafficked animals. Endangered 
species traffickers will go to great lengths to smuggle wildlife including forging 
documents, smuggling protected species with non-protected species, sedating animals 
and disguising animals and their part or derivatives to appear to be legal. Ensure all 
papers purporting to allow trade such as CITES permits are examined thoroughly and 
that any investigative leads noted and pursued. The ASEAN Wildlife Enforcement 
Network and other regional platforms should be utilized and informed when trafficking is 
found to be transnational.</p>
