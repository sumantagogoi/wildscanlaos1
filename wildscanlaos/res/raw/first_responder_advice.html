<p>Always avoid handling animals unless necessary. Many endangered species can be
dangerous, sensitive to stress and can pose disease risk to humans. Contact expert 
handlers as soon as possible to care for trafficked animals. If you must handle animals, 
their parts or derivative products, ensure the appropriate safety measures are taken 
including wearing personal protective equipment such as gloves and a mask. Specific 
care instructions can be found in each of the species' pages in the Species Library of 
Wildscan. Many animals will less prone to stress if isolated from other animals and loud 
noises. Cloths can be placed over cages and animals which are found in sacks should 
not be removed unless advised by an expert. Many animals which are trafficked are 
dehydrated and should be provided with clean drinking water as soon as possible.</p>
