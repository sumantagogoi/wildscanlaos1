<p>DO NOT BUY endangered species, their parts or derivative products. The demand for endangered 
species, from ivory collectors to tourists buying shells and other souvenirs, is what drives the illegal trade 
in endangered species. International trade or transport of many endangered species, parts and derived 
products is either illegal or heavily regulated and breaking these laws carries heavy penalties including 
prison time and/or fines. Most countries also have national laws which prohibit the possession, hunting 
and sale/purchase of protected species. Many of the traditional medicines derived from wildlife have 
no proven medicinal benefits. Disreputable tourism operators and farms have often been linked to the 
trafficking, illegal breeding, abuse and killing of endangered species. Do not support operators that fail to 
be transparent about the source of their animals. Ensure you are aware that the products you purchase 
are legal and not protected by national and international laws. Create awareness by sharing knowledge 
with peers, speak out and report suspicious wildlife trade to trusted authorities and Wildscan.</p>
