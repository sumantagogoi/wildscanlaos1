<p>Wildscan is a comprehensive species identification and response mobile application
designed to combat wildlife trafficking. The application is designed to help front-line 
enforcement agencies, wildlife conservation officers, and the general public correctly 
identify, report and handle marine, freshwater and terrestrial animals caught in 
illegal wildlife trade. WildScan places critical information on endangered species at 
the fingertips of those who need it most and provides a tool to report wildlife crime. 
WildScan contains a comprehensive species library with more than 250 endangered 
animals commonly smuggled into and throughout Southeast Asia, a global hotspot for 
wildlife trafficking. The application will be available for free on Android devices with 
multiple platform and language support available in 2015.</p>

<p>WildScan was developed by <a href=http://www.freeland.org>Freeland</a> as part of the Asia's Regional Response
to Endangered Species Trafficking (ARREST) Program, The U.S. Government's 
largest counter wildlife trafficking initiative funded by the U.S. Agency for International 
Development. The application was produced with in-kind support from technology firm 
<a href=http://vimi.co>vimi.co</a> and many government agencies and private sector organizations.</p>
